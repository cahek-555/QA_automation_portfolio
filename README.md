# Task 1: software configuration.
## Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?
Hello to everyone who looked at me. 
The answer to the question is simple. I really like to automate everything, especially routine work. And the process of writing code causes only positive emotions.
I invite you to familiarize yourself with my work. ðŸ˜Ž
